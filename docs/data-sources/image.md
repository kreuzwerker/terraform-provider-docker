# docker_image (Data Source)

`docker_image` provides details about a specific Docker Image which need to be presend on the Docker Host

## Example Usage

```terraform
# uses the 'latest' tag
data "docker_image" "latest" {
  name = "nginx"
}

# uses a specific tag
data "docker_image" "specific" {
  name = "nginx:1.17.6"
}

# use the image digest
data "docker_image" "digest" {
  name = "nginx@sha256:36b74457bccb56fbf8b05f79c85569501b721d4db813b684391d63e02287c0b2"
}

# uses the tag and the image digest
data "docker_image" "tag_and_digest" {
  name = "nginx:1.19.1@sha256:36b74457bccb56fbf8b05f79c85569501b721d4db813b684391d63e02287c0b2"

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the Docker image, including any tags or SHA256 repo digests.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `repo_digest` (String) The image sha256 digest in the form of `repo[:tag]@sha256:<hash>`. It may be empty in the edge case where the local image was pulled from a repo, tagged locally, and then referred to in the data source by that local name/tag.
