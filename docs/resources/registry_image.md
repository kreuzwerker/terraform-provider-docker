# Resource (docker_registry_image)

Manages the lifecycle of docker image/tag in a registry means it can store one or more version of specific docker images and identified by their tags.

## Example Usage

To be able to update an image itself when an updated image arrives.

```terraform
resource "docker_registry_image" "helloworld" {
  name = "helloworld:1.0"

  build {
    context = "${path.cwd}/absolutePathToContextFolder"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the Docker image.

### Optional

- `build` (Block List, Max: 1, Deprecated) Definition for building the image (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--build))
- `insecure_skip_verify` (Boolean) If `true`, the verification of TLS certificates of the server/registry is disabled. Defaults to `false`
- `keep_remotely` (Boolean) If true, then the Docker image won't be deleted on destroy operation. If this is false, it will delete the image from the docker registry on destroy operation. Defaults to `false`
- `triggers` (Map of String) A map of arbitrary strings that, when changed, will force the `docker_registry_image` resource to be replaced. This can be used to repush a local image

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `sha256_digest` (String) The sha256 digest of the image.

### Nested Schema for `build`

Required:

- `context` (String) The absolute path to the context folder. You can use the helper function '${path.cwd}/context-dir'.

Optional:

- `auth_config` (Block List) The configuration for the authentication (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--build--auth_config))
- `build_args` (Map of String) Pairs for build-time variables in the form TODO
- `build_id` (String) BuildID is an optional identifier that can be passed together with the build request. The same identifier can be used to gracefully cancel the build with the cancel request.
- `cache_from` (List of String) Images to consider as cache sources
- `cgroup_parent` (String) Optional parent cgroup for the container
- `cpu_period` (Number) The length of a CPU period in microseconds
- `cpu_quota` (Number) Microseconds of CPU time that the container can get in a CPU period
- `cpu_set_cpus` (String) CPUs in which to allow execution (e.g., `0-3`, `0`, `1`)
- `cpu_set_mems` (String) MEMs in which to allow execution (`0-3`, `0`, `1`)
- `cpu_shares` (Number) CPU shares (relative weight)
- `dockerfile` (String) Dockerfile file. Defaults to `Dockerfile`
- `extra_hosts` (List of String) A list of hostnames/IP mappings to add to the containerâ€™s /etc/hosts file. Specified in the form ["hostname:IP"]
- `force_remove` (Boolean) Always remove intermediate containers
- `isolation` (String) Isolation represents the isolation technology of a container. The supported values are
- `labels` (Map of String) User-defined key/value metadata
- `memory` (Number) Set memory limit for build
- `memory_swap` (Number) Total memory (memory + swap), -1 to enable unlimited swap
- `network_mode` (String) Set the networking mode for the RUN instructions during build
- `no_cache` (Boolean) Do not use the cache when building the image
- `platform` (String) Set platform if server is multi-platform capable
- `pull_parent` (Boolean) Attempt to pull the image even if an older image exists locally
