# docker_image (Resource)

Pulls a Docker image to a given Docker host from a Docker Registry.
 This resource will *not* pull new layers of the image automatically unless used in conjunction with [docker_registry_image](registry_image.md) data source to update the `pull_triggers` field.

## Example Usage

### Basic

Finds and downloads the latest `ubuntu:precise` image but does not check
for further updates of the image

```terraform
resource "docker_image" "ubuntu" {
  name = "ubuntu:precise"
}
```

### Dynamic updates

To be able to update an update dynamically when the `sha256` sum changes,
you need to use it in combination with `docker_registry_image` as follows:

```terraform
data "docker_registry_image" "ubuntu" {
  name = "ubuntu:precise"
}

resource "docker_image" "ubuntu" {
  name          = data.docker_registry_image.ubuntu.name
  pull_triggers = [data.docker_registry_image.ubuntu.sha256_digest]
}
```

### Build

You can also use the resource to build and image.
In thid case the image "zoo" and "zoo:develop" are built.

```terraform
resource "docker_image" "zoo" {
  name = "zoo"
  build {
    path = "."
    tag  = ["zoo:develop"]
    build_arg = {
      foo : "zoo"
    }
    label = {
      author : "zoo"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) The name of the Docker image, including any tags or SHA256 repo digests.

### Optional

- **build** (Block Set, Max: 1) Configuration to build an image. Please see [docker build command reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#options) too. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--build))
- **force_remove** (Boolean) If true, then the image is removed forcibly when the resource is destroyed.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **keep_locally** (Boolean) If true, then the Docker image won't be deleted on destroy operation. If this is false, it will delete the image from the docker local storage on destroy operation.
- **pull_trigger** (String, Deprecated) A value which cause an image pull when changed
- **pull_triggers** (Set of String) List of values which cause an image pull when changed. This is used to store the image digest from the registry when using the [docker_registry_image](../data-sources/registry_image.md).

### Read-Only

- **latest** (String) The ID of the image.
- **output** (String, Deprecated)

<a id="nestedblock--build"></a>
### Nested Schema for `build`

Required:

- **path** (String) Context path

Optional:

- **build_arg** (Map of String) Set build-time variables
- **dockerfile** (String) Name of the Dockerfile. Defaults to `Dockerfile`.
- **force_remove** (Boolean) Always remove intermediate containers
- **label** (Map of String) Set metadata for an image
- **no_cache** (Boolean) Do not use cache when building the image
- **remove** (Boolean) Remove intermediate containers after a successful build. Defaults to  `true`.
- **tag** (List of String) Name and optionally a tag in the 'name:tag' format
- **target** (String) Set the target build stage to build
