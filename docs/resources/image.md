# Resource (docker_image)

Pulls a Docker image to a given Docker host from a Docker Registry.
 This resource will *not* pull new layers of the image automatically unless used in conjunction with [docker_registry_image](registry_image.md) data source to update the `pull_triggers` field.

## Example Usage

### Basic

Finds and downloads the latest `ubuntu:precise` image but does not check
for further updates of the image

```terraform
resource "docker_image" "ubuntu" {
  name = "ubuntu:precise"
}
```

### Dynamic updates

To be able to update an image dynamically when the `sha256` sum changes,
you need to use it in combination with `docker_registry_image` as follows:

```terraform
data "docker_registry_image" "ubuntu" {
  name = "ubuntu:precise"
}

resource "docker_image" "ubuntu" {
  name          = data.docker_registry_image.ubuntu.name
  pull_triggers = [data.docker_registry_image.ubuntu.sha256_digest]
}
```

### Build

You can also use the resource to build an image.
In this case the image "zoo" and "zoo:develop" are built.

```terraform
resource "docker_image" "zoo" {
  name = "zoo"
  build {
    context = "."
    tag     = ["zoo:develop"]
    build_arg = {
      foo : "zoo"
    }
    label = {
      author : "zoo"
    }
  }
}
```

You can use the `triggers` argument to specify when the image should be rebuild. This is for example helpful when you want to rebuild the docker image whenever the source code changes.

```terraform
resource "docker_image" "zoo" {
  name = "zoo"
  build {
    context = "."
  }
  triggers = {
    dir_sha1 = sha1(join("", [for f in fileset(path.module, "src/*") : filesha1(f)]))
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the Docker image, including any tags or SHA256 repo digests.

### Optional

- `build` (Block Set, Max: 1) Configuration to build an image. Please see [docker build command reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#options) too. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--build))
- `force_remove` (Boolean) If true, then the image is removed forcibly when the resource is destroyed.
- `keep_locally` (Boolean) If true, then the Docker image won't be deleted on destroy operation. If this is false, it will delete the image from the docker local storage on destroy operation.
- `platform` (String) The platform to use when pulling the image. Defaults to the platform of the current machine.
- `pull_triggers` (Set of String) List of values which cause an image pull when changed. This is used to store the image digest from the registry when using the [docker_registry_image](../data-sources/registry_image.md).
- `triggers` (Map of String) A map of arbitrary strings that, when changed, will force the `docker_image` resource to be replaced. This can be used to rebuild an image when contents of source code folders change

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this resource. This is not the image ID, but the ID of the resource in the Terraform state. This is used to identify the resource in the Terraform state. To reference the correct image ID, use the `image_id` attribute.
- `image_id` (String) The ID of the image (as seen when executing `docker inspect` on the image). Can be used to reference the image via its ID in other resources.
- `repo_digest` (String) The image sha256 digest in the form of `repo[:tag]@sha256:<hash>`.

### Nested Schema for `build`

Required:

- `context` (String) Value to specify the build context. Currently, only a `PATH` context is supported. You can use the helper function '${path.cwd}/context-dir'. Please see https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/ for more information about build contexts.

Optional:

- `auth_config` (Block List) The configuration for the authentication (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--build--auth_config))
- `build_arg` (Map of String) Set build-time variables
- `build_args` (Map of String) Pairs for build-time variables in the form TODO
- `build_id` (String) BuildID is an optional identifier that can be passed together with the build request. The same identifier can be used to gracefully cancel the build with the cancel request.
- `cache_from` (List of String) Images to consider as cache sources
- `cgroup_parent` (String) Optional parent cgroup for the container
- `cpu_period` (Number) The length of a CPU period in microseconds
- `cpu_quota` (Number) Microseconds of CPU time that the container can get in a CPU period
- `cpu_set_cpus` (String) CPUs in which to allow execution (e.g., `0-3`, `0`, `1`)
- `cpu_set_mems` (String) MEMs in which to allow execution (`0-3`, `0`, `1`)
- `cpu_shares` (Number) CPU shares (relative weight)
- `dockerfile` (String) Name of the Dockerfile. Defaults to `Dockerfile`.
- `extra_hosts` (List of String) A list of hostnames/IP mappings to add to the containerâ€™s /etc/hosts file. Specified in the form ["hostname:IP"]
- `force_remove` (Boolean) Always remove intermediate containers
- `isolation` (String) Isolation represents the isolation technology of a container. The supported values are
- `label` (Map of String) Set metadata for an image
- `labels` (Map of String) User-defined key/value metadata
- `memory` (Number) Set memory limit for build
- `memory_swap` (Number) Total memory (memory + swap), -1 to enable unlimited swap
- `network_mode` (String) Set the networking mode for the RUN instructions during build
- `no_cache` (Boolean) Do not use the cache when building the image
- `platform` (String) Set platform if server is multi-platform capable
- `pull_parent` (Boolean) Attempt to pull the image even if an older image exists locally
- `remote_context` (String) A Git repository URI or HTTP/HTTPS context URI
- `remove` (Boolean) Remove intermediate containers after a successful build. Defaults to `true`.
- `security_opt` (List of String) The security options
- `session_id` (String) Set an ID for the build session
- `shm_size` (Number) Size of /dev/shm in bytes. The size must be greater than 0
- `squash` (Boolean) If true the new layers are squashed into a new image with a single new layer
- `suppress_output` (Boolean) Suppress the build output and print image ID on success
- `tag` (List of String) Name and optionally a tag in the 'name:tag' format
- `target` (String) Set the target build stage to build
- `ulimit` (Block List) Configuration for ulimits (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--build--ulimit))
- `version` (String) Version of the underlying builder to use
