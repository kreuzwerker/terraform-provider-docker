name: 🐛 Bug Report
about: If something isn't working as expected 🤔.

---

<!---
Please note the following potential times when an issue might be in Terraform core:

* [Configuration Language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html) or resource ordering issues
* [State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) and [State Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html) issues
* [Provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html) issues
* [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
* Spans resources across multiple providers

If you are running into one of these scenarios, we recommend opening an issue in the [Terraform core repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) instead.
