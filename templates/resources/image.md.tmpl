## Example Usage

### Basic

Finds and downloads the latest `ubuntu:precise` image but does not check
for further updates of the image

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource.tf"}}

### Dynamic updates

To be able to update an image dynamically when the `sha256` sum changes,
you need to use it in combination with `docker_registry_image` as follows:

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource-dynamic.tf"}}

### Build

You can also use the resource to build an image.

-> **Note**: The default timeout for the building is 20 minutes. If you need to increase this, you can use [operation timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts).

In this case the image "zoo" and "zoo:develop" are built.
The `context` and `dockerfile` arguments are relative to the local Terraform process (`path.cwd`).
There is no need to copy the files to remote hosts before creating the resource.

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource-build.tf"}}

You can use the `triggers` argument to specify when the image should be rebuild. This is for example helpful when you want to rebuild the docker image whenever the source code changes.

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource-build-triggers.tf"}}

### Buildx

-> **Note**: The buildx feature is currently in preview and may have some quirks. Known issues: Setting `ulimits` will not work.

The `build` argument uses the legacy docker builder. If you want to use a buildx builder, you need to set the `builder` argument. For the default buildx builder, you can set the `builder` argument to `default`. For a custom buildx builder, you can set the `builder` argument to the name of the builder. You can find the name of the builder by running `docker buildx ls`.
