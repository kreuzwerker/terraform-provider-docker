## Example Usage

### Basic

Finds and downloads the latest `ubuntu:precise` image but does not check
for further updates of the image

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource.tf"}}

### Dynamic updates

To be able to update an image dynamically when the `sha256` sum changes,
you need to use it in combination with `docker_registry_image` as follows:

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource-dynamic.tf"}}

## Build

You can also use the resource to build an image. If you want to use a buildx builder with all of its features, please read the section below.

-> **Note**: The default timeout for the building is 20 minutes. If you need to increase this, you can use [operation timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts).

In this case the image "zoo" and "zoo:develop" are built.
The `context` path is resolved on the machine running Terraform (relative paths are relative to the current working directory, i.e. `path.cwd`).
If `dockerfile` is not an absolute path, it is resolved relative to `context`.
There is no need to copy the files to remote hosts before creating the resource.

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource-build.tf"}}

You can use the `triggers` argument to specify when the image should be rebuild. This is for example helpful when you want to rebuild the docker image whenever the source code changes.

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource-build-triggers.tf"}}

## Buildx

-> **Note**: The buildx feature is currently in preview and may have some quirks. Known issues: Setting `ulimits` will not work.

If buildx is available, the provider will use it by default.

To force the legacy builder, set `use_legacy_builder = true` in the `build` block.

To select a specific buildx builder, set the `builder` argument (for the default buildx builder, use `default`). For a custom buildx builder, set `builder` to the builder name (see `docker buildx ls`).

The single platform build result is automatically loaded to `docker images`.
