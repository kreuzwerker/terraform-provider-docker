## Example Usage

### Basic

Finds and downloads the latest `ubuntu:precise` image but does not check
for further updates of the image

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource.tf"}}

### Dynamic updates

To be able to update an image dynamically when the `sha256` sum changes,
you need to use it in combination with `docker_registry_image` as follows:

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource-dynamic.tf"}}

### Build

You can also use the resource to build an image.
In thid case the image "zoo" and "zoo:develop" are built.

{{tffile "examples/resources/docker_image/resource-build.tf"}}
