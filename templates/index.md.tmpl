# Docker Provider

The Docker provider is used to interact with Docker containers and images.
It uses the Docker API to manage the lifecycle of Docker containers. Because
the Docker provider uses the Docker API, it is immediately compatible not
only with single server Docker but Swarm and any additional Docker-compatible
API hosts.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Terraform 0.13 and later:

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider-tf13.tf"}}

Terraform 0.12 and earlier:

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider-tf12.tf"}}

-> **Note**
You can also use the `ssh` protocol to connect to the docker host on a remote machine.
The configuration would look as follows:

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider-ssh.tf"}}

## Registry credentials

Registry credentials can be provided on a per-registry basis with the `registry_auth`
field, passing either a config file or the username/password directly.

-> **Note**
The location of the config file is on the machine terraform runs on, nevertheless if the specified docker host is on another machine.

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider-credentials.tf"}}

-> **Note**
When passing in a config file either the corresponding `auth` string of the repository is read or the os specific
[credential helpers](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers#available-programs) are
used to retrieve the authentication credentials.

You can still use the environment variables `DOCKER_REGISTRY_USER` and `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASS`.

An example content of the file `~/.docker/config.json` on macOS may look like follows:

{{codefile "json" "examples/provider/provider-docker-config.json"}}

## Certificate information

Specify certificate information either with a directory or
directly with the content of the files for connecting to the Docker host via TLS.

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider-cert.tf"}}
