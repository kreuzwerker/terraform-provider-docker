  Manages the lifecycle of a Docker service.

# docker\_service

This resource manages the lifecycle of a Docker service. By default, the creation, update and delete of services are detached.

With the [Converge Config](#convergeconfig) the behavior of the `docker cli` is imitated to guarantee that
for example, all tasks of a service are running or successfully updated or to inform `terraform` that a service could not
be updated and was successfully rolled back.

## Example Usage
The following examples show the basic and advanced usage of the
Docker Service resource assuming the host machine is already part of a Swarm.

### Basic
The following configuration starts a Docker Service with 
- the given image, 
- 1 replica
- exposes the port `8080` in `vip` mode to the host machine
- moreover, uses the `container` runtime

```hcl
resource "docker_service" "foo" {
  name = "foo-service"

  task_spec {
    container_spec {
      image = "repo.mycompany.com:8080/foo-service:v1"
    }
  }

  endpoint_spec {
    ports {
      target_port = "8080"
    }
  }
}
```

The following command is the equivalent:

```bash
$ docker service create -d -p 8080 --name foo-service repo.mycompany.com:8080/foo-service:v1
```

### Advanced
The following configuration shows the full capabilities of a Docker Service. Currently, the [Docker API 1.32](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.32) is implemented.

```hcl
resource "docker_volume" "test_volume" {
  name = "tftest-volume"
}

resource "docker_config" "service_config" {
  name = "tftest-full-myconfig"
  data = "ewogICJwcmVmaXgiOiAiMTIzIgp9"
}

  name = "tftest-mysecret"
  data = "ewogICJrZXkiOiAiUVdFUlRZIgp9"
}

  name   = "tftest-network"
  driver = "overlay"
}

### Converge Config

`converge_config` is a block within the configuration that can be repeated only **once** to specify the extra Converging configuration for the containers of the service. This is the same behavior as the `docker cli`. By adding this configuration, it is monitored with the
given interval that, e.g., all tasks/replicas of a service are up and healthy

The `converge_config` block supports the following:

* `delay` - (Optional, string) Time between each the check to check docker endpoint `(ms|s|m|h)`. For example, to check if
all tasks are up when a service is created, or to check if all tasks are successfully updated on an update. Default: `7s`.
* `timeout` - (Optional, string) The timeout of the service to reach the desired state `(s|m)`. Default: `3m`.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the above configuration:

* `id` (string)

## Import

Docker service can be imported using the long id, e.g. for a service with the short id `55ba873dd`:

```sh
$ terraform import docker_service.foo $(docker service inspect -f {{.ID}} 55b)
```
